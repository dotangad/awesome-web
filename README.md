## Design Inspiration
 - [Oswald Labs Website](https://oswaldlabs.com)
 - [Naman Sood's Wikipedia Redesign](https://wikipedia.nsood.in)

## Portfolios/Personal Websites
 - [Kabir Goel](https://kabirgoel.com)  
   Minimal with little distractions, yet displays Kabir's skills and work perfectly. The skill component looks nice but I don't like it when people use relative units (bars, percentages) to convey their proficiency with something. Not using cards for projects was also something a little uncommon but this website does it well.
